PROJECT 4
📌 Problem Description

Write a program to decide whether a user gets a Personal Loan based on:

1️⃣ Age Condition

Must be between 21 and 60.

2️⃣ Income Condition

Monthly income must be ₹25,000 or more.

3️⃣ CIBIL Score

Must be 700 or above (max = 900).

4️⃣ Existing Loan Check

If user already has an active loan:

They need higher income (₹40,000+) to qualify.

5️⃣ High Risk Cases

If ANY of these happen → Loan Rejected Immediately:

CIBIL < 550

Income < 15,000

Age < 18



⭐ LEVEL 5 PROJECT — INSURANCE RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (Enterprise-Level Logic)

This system decides whether a user gets a Health Insurance Plan, and at what premium, based on multiple factors.

This is how real insurance companies classify customers into Low, Medium, and High risk.

📌 INPUTS

User must enter:

Age

Smoker (yes/no)

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Any major disease? (yes/no)

Daily exercise mins

Alcohol consumption (yes/no)

📌 RULES (Realistic & Complex)
🔴 Immediate High-Risk (Auto Reject)

If ANY is true:

Age > 70

BMI > 40

Major disease = yes

→ Insurance Rejected Immediately

🟠 Medium Risk (Higher Premium)

If any of the following:

Age between 45–70

BMI between 30–40

Smoker = yes

Alcohol = yes

Exercise < 20 min/day

→ Plan Approved, but Premium = High

🟢 Low Risk (Normal Premium)

All must be true:

Age < 45

Non-smoker

BMI < 30

No major disease

Exercise ≥ 30 min/day

→ Plan Approved, Premium = Normal

⚠️ Special Case

If:

Age < 30

BMI between 30–35

Exercises 40+ min/day

→ Approved with Discount
(reason: young + compensating habits)

🌟 Outputs You Must Print

“Insurance Rejected — Reason: ___”

“Approved — High Premium”

“Approved — Normal Premium”

“Approved — Discounted Premium”
