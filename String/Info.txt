✅ What Is a String?
A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in:
Single quotes → 'Hello'
Double quotes → "Hello"
Triple quotes (for multi-line text)

'''Hello'''

"""Hello"""

SUDE TO STORE SENTENCE AND DISPLAY IT


🔹 Examples
name = "Adanin"
message = 'Welcome to Python!'
paragraph = """This is a
multi-line string."""



🔍 Key Properties of Strings
1. Strings are sequences

You can access characters by index:

word = "Python"
print(word[0])   # P
print(word[3])   # h




2. Strings are immutable

You cannot change individual characters once a string is created.

text = "Hello"
text[0] = "Y"   # ❌ Error




3. Strings support slicing

Extract parts of the string:

s = "Machine Learning"
print(s[0:7])    # Machine
print(s[8:])     # Learning





🛠️ Useful String Functions
Function	What It Does
len(s)	Length of string
s.lower()	Convert to lowercase
s.upper()	Convert to uppercase
s.strip()	Remove spaces
s.replace("old", "new")	Replace text
s.split()	Split into list of words
' '.join(list)	Join list into string

🎯 Real-Life Example
user = "  SUMIT  "
clean = user.strip().capitalize()
print(clean)    # Sumit




📌 Summary

Strings = text data

Enclosed in quotes

Ordered and immutable

Can be sliced and processed using many built-in methods
